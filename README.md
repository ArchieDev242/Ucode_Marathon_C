  ### Introduction
  Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹
  Iâ€™d like to share my journey with Marathon C. Itâ€™s an incredible opportunity to dive deep into the world of coding and challenge yourself. Throughout this program, youâ€™ll encounter various tasks and hurdles, but trust me, the skills and knowledge you gain will be worth every effort. This Marathon isnâ€™t just about learning how to code, itâ€™s about building a solid foundation in computer science and preparing for future challenges, technologies, and programming languages.

As Iâ€™ve learned here: education isnâ€™t just preparation for life â€” itâ€™s a part of life. So, if youâ€™re ready to start, letâ€™s dive in together!

## Whatâ€™s Marathon C?

Marathon C is a journey into the world of **computer science**. Itâ€™s not an easy ride â€“ trust me â€“ but every challenge you overcome makes it worthwhile. By the end of this marathon, youâ€™ll have a solid foundation in programming and be ready to explore new technologies and languages.

The mantra here is simple: education is not just preparation for life, itâ€™s an essential part of life.

  ### Whatâ€™s the Big Idea?
  The core idea of this Marathon is simple: find your way to success.

  The essential question that drives the experience is:
  How can you effectively use all the components of an educational system to gain as much experience as possible?

  The challenge itself is straightforward â€” start learning programming.

  ### The Journey
  How to effectively use all the components of the educational system to get as much experience as possible?

### The Challenge:
**Start learning programming!**

## Letâ€™s Investigate

### Guiding Questions

These are some of the questions that got me thinking and helped me start my journey. Maybe theyâ€™ll help you too:

- Who am I? Whatâ€™s my background? Why do I want to learn programming?
- What ideas can I bring to life with programming?
- What skills do I want to develop, and what projects would I love to create?
- What do I need to get started? Am I ready to take the leap?

### Guiding Activities

Hereâ€™s how I tackled the challenge step by step:

1. **Learned about operating systems (OS)** and set up the tools I needed.
2. **Connected to the ucode connect** and explored the environment.
3. Opened the **Terminal/iTerm** utility to get comfortable with the **command-line interface**.
4. Explored the text editors like **Vim** or **Emacs** (it took a while to figure out how to exit Vim ðŸ˜…).
5. Watched tutorials and cloned my first Git repository with `git clone`.
6. Collaborated with peers, sharing knowledge and experiences.

## The Analysis

Hereâ€™s what I learned:

- Always analyze examples carefully; the details matter.
- Stick to the tasks outlined in the challenge â€“ no shortcuts or extra fluff.
- Follow the guidelines for submission â€“ keep it clean and structured.
- Use tools like the Terminal or iTerm with `zsh`.
- Peer-to-peer learning is fantastic, and asking for help is a sign of strength.
- Finally, **think critically and follow the white rabbit.**

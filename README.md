  ### Introduction
  Hey everyone! 👋
  Welcome to my journey with **Marathon C**, a transformative program that immerses you in the intricate world of coding. This experience is not merely about learning to write code; it’s about fostering a deep understanding of computer science, mastering problem-solving, and preparing for future technological challenges. It’s a journey where persistence pays off, and every hurdle overcome adds to your growth as a programmer.

  As I’ve learned, education is not just a stepping stone — it’s a vital part of life itself. If you’re eager to embark on this exciting challenge, let’s dive in together!

## What’s Marathon C?

Marathon C is an intensive exploration of programming fundamentals. While the path may be challenging, the rewards — a strong foundation in computer science and readiness to tackle advanced technologies — are invaluable. The program’s philosophy is simple yet profound: **education is not merely preparation for life, it’s an indispensable part of living.**

  ### What’s the Big Idea?
  The core idea of this Marathon is simple: find your way to success.

  The essential question that drives the experience is:
  How can you effectively use all the components of an educational system to gain as much experience as possible?

  The challenge itself is straightforward — start learning programming.

  ### The Journey
  How to effectively use all the components of the educational system to get as much experience as possible?

### The Challenge:
**Start learning programming!**

## Let’s Investigate

### Guiding Questions

These are some of the questions that got me thinking and helped me start my journey. Maybe they’ll help you too:

- Who am I? What’s my background? Why do I want to learn programming?
- What ideas can I bring to life with programming?
- What skills do I want to develop, and what projects would I love to create?
- What do I need to get started? Am I ready to take the leap?

### Guiding Activities

Here’s how I tackled the challenge step by step:

1. **Learned about operating systems (OS)** and set up the tools I needed.
2. **Connected to the ucode connect** and explored the environment.
3. Opened the **Terminal/iTerm** utility to get comfortable with the **command-line interface**.
4. Explored the text editors like **Vim** or **Emacs** (it took a while to figure out how to exit Vim 😅).
5. Watched tutorials and cloned my first Git repository with `git clone`.
6. Collaborated with peers, sharing knowledge and experiences.

## The Analysis

Here’s what I learned:

- Always analyze examples carefully, the details matter.
- Stick to the tasks outlined in the challenge – no shortcuts or extra fluff.
- Follow the guidelines for submission – keep it clean and structured.
- Use tools like the Terminal or iTerm with `zsh`.
- Peer-to-peer learning is fantastic, and asking for help is a sign of strength.
- Finally, **think critically and follow the white rabbit.**
